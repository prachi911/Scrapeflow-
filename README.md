Scrapeflow â€” Intelligent Web Scraping Engine
Scrapeflow is a modern, scalable web scraping engine that leverages headless browsers and Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract data from both static and JavaScript-heavy dynamic websites. It is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional scraping tools by simulating real user behavior and enhancing data parsing through AI.

Features
Headless scraping with Puppeteer and Curio

AI-based content parsing using OpenAI/Gemini APIs

GUI workflow builder using Next.js and React Flow

Secure backend with Supabase, Prisma, and NextAuth

IP rotation, session management, and task scheduling

Highlights
Dual-mode scraping: HTML selectors + AI extraction

Real-time automation via webhooks and cron jobs

Designed for both technical and non-technical users




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
